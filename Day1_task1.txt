Problem : why the dates in the calendar of sep 1752 are missing.
Solution: The reason for skipping the dates was an outcome of aligning the British calendar with that of the catholic calendar. 
This all started about 1300 years before 18th century. In those early days, a year was measured to be of 365 days and 6 hours where it was actually 365 days 5 hours and 49 minutes. That seems close enough, but over time this accumulates to a big number.
11 minutes per year*1300 years would about 10 days. This started creating problems and hence the catholic church decided to move to the new calendar. The British empire, then being vast, thought that it was OK for them to have their own calendar while rest of Eupore followed the new calendar. Eventually after 170 years later, the British, understanding the confusion this was causing, decided to change their calendar to match with the catholic calendar, which means they had to skip those 11 days in certain and this was decided to be the month of September in 1752.
